Announcement
1. Since the problem doesn't says that we can order a dish multiple times. In my program, each dish can only be ordered once pre combination.  

2. Personally, I believe it is a typo that there is an empty line between Target price and mixed fruit in the sample data, so my program doesn't have a method to deal with that kind of situation. (I also don't think there is a general method to solve this problem, since it could contains multiple empty line, we can only fix it manually)


Instruction
1. Unzip the file;
2. You will find a jar file in a folder named target. Run webley-0.jar file in terminal using following command:
		java -jar webley-0.jar data_path
		(emample for data_path: /Users/yuki/Desktop/a.csv)
3. In case the jar file doesn't work or you want to make some change to my code, you can alway regenerate the jar file by running 
						mvn clean package
in the webley folder.
